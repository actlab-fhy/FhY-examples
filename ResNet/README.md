# ResNet

The various programs here are for implementations of ResNet, a deep learning model for image classification first proposed by He *et al.* in their paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition".
The *FhY* code itself is modeled after the authors' original implementation using Caffe (which can be found [here](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks)) and the torchvision implementation (which can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/resnet.py)).
