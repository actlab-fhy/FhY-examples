# ResNet50 Inference

This code implements the forward (i.e., inference) pass for ResNet50, a deep learning model for image classification first proposed by He *et al.* in their paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition".
The *FhY* code itself is modeled after the authors' original implementation using Caffe, which can be found [here](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks).
